\subsection{a.)}
Suppose that $X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$ and $Y = \frac{1}{|X|}$.

\subsubsection{i.)}

We wish to discern if the function $f(x)= \frac{1}{|x|} : x \neq 0$ has
monotonicity.

Clearly we have weak-monotonicity, since if $0 < x_1 \leq x_2$, we have that
$f(x_1) \geq f(x_2)$ and if $x_1 \leq x_2 < 0$ we then have $f(x_1) \leq f(x_2)$.

\subsubsection{ii.)}

Show that $F_Y(y) = F_X(\frac{1}{y}) - F_X(-\frac{1}{y})$.
